## Format and Rules

Form teams of 3-4 middle-school students and compete together! MCAMC is structured into 4 rounds, each round lasting 1 hour.

### Individual Round

The Individual Round comes first and is the most traditional of the 3 rounds and comes first. There are 30 questions spanning various topics. The questions will be similar in difficulty to the AMC 8.

### Team Round

The Team Round comes second. You will be working within your team of 3-4 students to solve another 30 questions, but there's twist! This time, all 30 questions will be related to one topic in mathematics — a topic that you've probably never seen before. We will provide enough background information and guidance to help you solve these questions, so be prepared to learn something new!

### Live Round

The Live Round is the third round, and you will again be working within your team. The style of the questions will be similar to that of the Individual Round, with a slight difficulty increase because you will be working as a team. Questions will come in sets of 3, and there are 10 sets of questions. The difficulty increases with every set.

This round will be scored in real-time! Teams will receive one set of questions at a time, and when the team is done with a set, they will submit their answers and receive the next set of questions. Answers may not be changed once they are submitted and will be graded on the spot, with the results immediately displayed on an online scoreboard.

### Countdown Round

The Countdown Round is the final round. In this round, the top 10 students from the individual round will be participating in a MATHCOUNTS-style ladder competition. The 10th place student will compete against the 9th place student to be the first to solve 3 questions correctly. The winner of this match will face the 8th place student, and so on and so forth until there is a final winner!

### Scoring

We've designed our scoring system to give more points to harder questions, as well as to prevent ties. The individual standings are determined solely with the Individual and Countdown Rounds, while team standings are calculated from a score that depends equally on the Individual Round scores of team members, your Team Round score, and your Live Round score.

### Awards

Various awards will be given to the top 10 individuals from the Individual Round, the top 3 individuals (and the individual winner) from the Countdown Round, and the top 3 teams!

### Registration

{: .question}
**Can you describe the overall registration process for our team?**

A new registration form must be submitted for each team of 3-4 students. The team will be asked to designate a coach or parent who will receive communications from MCAMC and make payments.

{: .question}
**Can I register as individual without a team?**

{: .answer}
Yes! If you do not have a team, you can register as an individual. On the day of the competition, you will be randomly placed with a team of other individual students, and you will be able to participate in all rounds just like everyone else. However, students must register as a team if they already have a group of 3-4 students they would like to work with.

{: .answer}
All students must be in middle school. Homeschooled students *may* participate. There are no location or age requirements.

{: .answer}
Yes! Any team from anywhere may participate, including but not limited to enrichment and weekend programs.

{: .answer}
You will need a writing utensil. Scrap paper will be provided, and the competition time will be displayed by proctors. Calculators, smart watches, or any other aids are prohibited.

{: .question}
**How will the competition operate?**  

{: .answer}
Competitors will take the competition simultaneously at the Middlesex County Academy. Each round will be proctored by high school and adult volunteers to ensure that there is no cheating.

### Payment

{: .question}
**What does the overall payment process look like?**  

{: .answer}
The total amount owed will be displayed before the registration form is submitted.

{: .question}
**How much does MCAMC cost?**

{: .answer}
MCAMC costs $30 per individual and $90 per team of 3-4 students (regardless of team size).

### Miscellaneous

{: .question}
**Does a high score on the MCAMC impact admission to Middlesex County Academy?**

{: .answer}
Our competition is not affiliated with the admissions process of our school. However, our admissions team is well aware of the rigor and importance of math competitions in general, including but not limited to the MCAMC. We encourage all those who enjoy math competions to apply!
